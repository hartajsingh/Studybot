Calendar Course Description
(COMP 474): Prerequisite: COMP 352 or COEN 352. Rule-based expert systems, blackboard architecture, and
agent-based.  Knowledge  acquisition  and  representation.  Uncertainty  and  conflict  resolution.  Reasoning  and
explanation. Design of intelligent systems. Project. Lectures: three hours per week. Laboratory: two hours per
week.

(COMP  6741): Knowledge  representation  and  reasoning.  Uncertainty  and  conflict  resolution.  Design  of
intelligent systems. Grammar-based, rule-based, and blackboard architectures. A project is required. Laboratory:
two hours per week.

Prerequisite Knowledge
You must be familiar with programming in an object-oriented language, such as Java or Python (we will provide a
brief introduction to Python as part of the first lab session). Previous knowledge of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and/or Machine Learning (ML) is helpful, but
not required.

Objectives
The goal of this course is to become familiar with modern “intelligent” (Artificial Intelligence, AI)-based software
systems, that is, software that incorporates algorithms or methods from one of the fields mentioned above (AI,
ML, NLP, IR), in whole or part. Compared to other courses introducing these concepts, this IS course places a
stronger emphasis on the overall design, implementation and evaluation of a complete AI application. 

General Information
This course has weekly lectures and lab sessions. For each week, lecture slides will be made available through the
course Moodle web site. Additionally, pre-recorded lectures will be published on Moodle for each week. That is,
lecture recordings are available in an asynchronous fashion and you can go through them on your own schedule. 

For most lectures, worksheets will be provided that you must go through while following the lecture material. You
should then post your answers on Moodle to receive feedback (detailed instructions will be provided on Moodle).

Additional online activities and office hours will also be announced and scheduled on Moodle.

Textbook
There is no single textbook for this course; readings for each lecture topic will be provided on Moodle. Generally,
these readings will be available online or as an electronic resource through the Concordia Library.

Course Moodle Web Site
Amendments to this syllabus, if any, as well as other important information will be made available through the
course's Moodle site. The Moodle site also provides additional reading material, as well as discussion forums for
asking questions on lecture topics, the project, exams, etc. Note that you must be registered for the course to
access the Moodle site (there is a one-day delay between registering and receiving Moodle access).

Evaluation
Your grade will  be based on a project, split  into  several project assignments, as well as multiple (3-4) timed
quizzes on the Moodle platform. The distribution of these deliverables is as follows:

45% Course Project (split into several assignments)
55% Exams (Online Moodle Quizzes) 
 

There is no standard relationship between percentages and letter grades assigned for this course. In order to pass
the course you must receive at least 50% of the overall possible marks.

If  the  final  exam grade is  greater  than the mid-term exam grade,  then the mid-term will  not  be  counted in
calculating the overall grade.

Note: It is your responsibility to adhere to the university’s code of conduct as detailed in the academic calendar.

Conditions Specific to Remote Teaching and Assessment
1 All students are expected to have access to a computer with the following capabilities:

1.a reliable internet connection
1.b camera and microphone (your computer and/or cellphone)

2 All  students  should  install  VPN  for  remote  desktop  access  to  Concordia  University  computer  labs
https://www.concordia.ca/it/support/connect-from-home.html
Once you have VPN connection to Concordia University, you can access all available software in Gina
Cody School labs by following the process described in:
https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/aits/support/faq/connect-from-home.html

3 Course specific software: You should install the Python programming language, together with a suitable
IDE. Further details on the required course software will be available on the course Moodle web site.

4 All students are required to do online, timed exams:
4.a Exams will be done through Moodle Quiz.
4.b The exams will  take place during the  lecture time period  on dates that will  be announced on

Moodle at least a week in advance.
4.c You will be responsible for ensuring appropriate, properly functioning technology (webcam, a

microphone, appropriate browser and an ability to download any necessary software, as well as a
reliable internet connection with a minimum of a 3G connection).

4.d You  will  need  a  quiet  place  within  which  to  take  the  quizzes.  Earplugs  or  noise-canceling
headphones that are not connected to a device may also be used to allow you to focus for the
duration of the exam.

4.e The  course  instructor  reserves  the  right  to  conduct  an  individual  oral  examination  to  verify
student’s response to online exam, project, or assignment questions.

5 Academic Integrity
Violation  of  the  Academic Code  of  Conduct  in  any form will  be  severely dealt  with.  This  includes
copying (even with modifications) of  program segments.  You must  demonstrate  independent  thought
through your submitted work. The Academic Code of Conduct of Concordia University is available at:
https://www.concordia.ca/conduct/academic-integrity.html

It is expected that during class discussions, in the online forums and in your written assignments you will
communicate constructively and respectfully. Sexist, racist, homophobic, ageist, and ablest expressions
will not be tolerated.

All students must read and sign the Expectations of Originality form and submit the signed copy with their
assignments and project.

Course Project
As part of the course, you will work on a project developing an intelligent software system. The project is split
into two project assignments that build on each other and you will have to demo your project as a team during
dedicated online (Zoom) sessions. You can work on the project in teams as follows:

• Students in COMP 474 can do the projects in teams of at most 4.
• Students in COMP 6741 must do the project in teams of 2.

Note: Mixed teams (including both graduate and undergraduate students) are not possible.
